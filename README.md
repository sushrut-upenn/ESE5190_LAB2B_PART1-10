Answers to the questions on ed discussion - 

Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? 
I found the parts 8 and 9 very confusing and unclear. More description and resources should have been provided in order to implement them. In part 8, I am unable to understand how the sequencer could be used to implement the APDS9960 protocol and exactly what is expected out of us. Similarly for part 9, I am facing the same difficulties.
 

Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? 
The integration of the APDS9960 protocol with the sequencer is very confusing as very little information has been provided which is why it is taking a lot of time to implement both of them.


Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement?
Parts 8 and 9 are very confusing and difficult to implement.


What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? 
I have been going through the implementation of parts 8 and 9 done by other students on GitHub.
