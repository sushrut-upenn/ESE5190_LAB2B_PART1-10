### TODO: PART 8

In Part 8, we have implemented the APDS9960 protocol to sense the proximity and intensity of light falling on the neopixel of QtPy. As seen in the gif and the image below whenever, we got our hand closer to the APDS9960 sensor the proximity value increased. When the intensity of light falling on the neopixel increases the respective values were recorded as shown below.
