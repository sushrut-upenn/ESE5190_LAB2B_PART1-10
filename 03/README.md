### TODO:PART 3 SEQUENCER

In this sequencer implementation we recorded the BOOT button presses and played them on the Neopixel LED of the Adafruit Qt Py RP2040. The recorded sequence of the BOOT button presses are stored in the RAM of the RP2040. In this implementation after the BOOT button is pressed it starts recording the BOOT button presses by storing it in an array. Then the loop is played on the neopixel led by using the values stored in the array. Thus the BOOT button presses are recorded and played on the Neopixel.
