The following task toggles the Qt Pyâ€™s Nepixel LED connected at GPIO 12 when the boot button at GPIO 21 is pressed. We need to also initialize the Power pin of the neopixel at GPIO 11 in order to use the in built Neopixel LED. For this code to work, header files like neopixel.h which includes the initialization of the neopixel are needed to be included in the folder. The rgb led can be set to any color using its hex value. In this case it is set to red.
